This repository contains the dataset, prompt templates, and implementation details for the paper:

**Bridging Human Judgments and LLMs: A Human-In-The-Loop Framework for Search Clarifications**  
Leila Tavakoli, Hamed Zamani  

The paper introduces a **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) workflow** for improving annotation quality in search clarification tasks. We evaluate multiple **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assess their ability to replicate human judgments and propose an efficient **hybrid approach** that reduces human effort while maintaining annotation quality.

## üìå Repository Contents

### üìÇ **Data**
- **`MIMICS-Duo-HITL.csv`**: Preprocessed dataset based on the **MIMICS-Duo** dataset, annotated for preference ranking, quality assessment, and aspect labeling (coverage, diversity, option order).
- **`sample_annotation_examples.json`**: Example query-clarification pairs and corresponding human labels.

### üìú **Prompts**
- **`zero_shot_prompt.txt`**: Prompt template for zero-shot annotation.
- **`few_shot_prompt.txt`**: Optimized prompt with few-shot examples.
- **`prompt_variations/`**: Sensitivity analysis prompts to evaluate the effect of different phrasing.

### üîß **Code**
- **`annotation_pipeline.py`**: Python script to run annotation tasks using LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3, Cohere Command R, Mistral 7B).
- **`hitl_framework.py`**: Implementation of the **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) system**, integrating confidence thresholding.
- **`evaluation_metrics.py`**: Scripts to compute **accuracy, Cohen‚Äôs Kappa, Pearson correlation**, and other evaluation metrics.

### üìä **Results**
- **`model_comparison.csv`**: Performance of LLMs across different annotation tasks.
- **`HITL_performance_analysis.csv`**: Results from HITL system showing reduction in human effort while maintaining annotation quality.
