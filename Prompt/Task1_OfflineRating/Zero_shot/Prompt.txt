You are tasked with rating how likely it is that a user (human) would prefer to engage with a clarification question and its associated options for a given query compared to other clarification questions.
The rating scale is from 1 to 5, where:
    
    1: The clarification and options are very unlikely to engage the user, as they are perceived as irrelevant or useless.
    2: The clarification and options are somewhat likely to engage the user but lack depth or strong relevance.
    3: The clarification and options are moderately likely to engage the user, showing some relevance and usefulness.
    4: The clarification and options are highly likely to engage the user, demonstrating strong relevance and helpfulness.
    5: The clarification and options are exceptionally likely to engage the user, being highly relevant, clear, and useful.   
  
    Query: {query}
    
    Clarification Questions and their options: {clarifications_str}
    
    Now, Based on the above query, and Clarification Questions and their options and shown examples, rate the human preference label of each clarification and its options
    on a scale from 1 to 5. You can give the same label to more than one clarification question and its options if you have no preferences. 
    Your response should only contain a single number between 1 and 5 for each clarification and its options, and nothing else.
    Additionally, rate your confidence in your response on a scale of 0% to 100%, where 0% means no confidence and 100% means absolute confidence.
    Provide your prediction for the label (a single number between 1 and 5) and your confidence level (as a percentage).
    Make sure you provide a Prediction and Confidence score for each Clarification Question with its Options for a given Query.
    Respond strictly in this format:
    Prediction: [1-5]
    Confidence: [0-100]%
