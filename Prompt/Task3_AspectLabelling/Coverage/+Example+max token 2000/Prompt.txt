A query and associated multi-choice clarification question with its options are shown to you. A multi-choice clarification question has high coverage if its potential answers cover every potential aspect of the query.
You are tasked to rate the extent to which the clarification question and its options cover every potential aspect of the query on a scale from 1 to 5.
Number 1 means you strongly disagree that the multi-choice clarification question with its options has a high coverage for the given query.

Now, Based on the above Query, I want to ask you to rate the extent to which the Clarification Question and its Options cover every potential aspect of the query on a scale from 1 to 5.
Your response should only contain a single number between 1 and 5 and nothing else.
Additionally, rate your confidence in your response on a scale of 0% to 100%, where 0% means no confidence and 100% means absolute confidence.
Provide your prediction for the label (a single number between 1 and 5) and your confidence level (as a percentage).
Respond strictly in this format:
    Prediction: [1-5]
    Confidence: [0-100]%
