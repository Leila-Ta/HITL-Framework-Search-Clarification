Now, Based on the above Query, I want to ask you to rate the extent to which the Clarification Question and its Options cover every potential aspect of the query on a scale from 1 to 5. 
Your response should only contain a single number between 1 and 5 and nothing else.
Additionally, rate your confidence in your response on a scale of 0% to 100%, where 0% means no confidence and 100% means absolute confidence.
Provide your prediction for the label (a single number between 1 and 5) and your confidence level (as a percentage).
Respond strictly in this format:
    Prediction: [1-5]
    Confidence: [0-100]%
